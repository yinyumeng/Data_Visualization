## Assignment 2

### Q1

> Q4 in task list: Show the popularity of categories (average backers per project) against the success rate of projects for each category.

#### explanation

For this question, I used Scatter chart, since Scatter charts are often used to find out if there's a relationship between two variables.

In this question, the sum of the total backers for each category and the total success number of projects for each category is calculated first.

After that, the sum values are divided by the total number of all projects to get the average value.

At last, the data processed by the provious step will be shown using Scatter Chart to show the relation of the two variabes.

Different colors are chosen for different catrgory in the chart and the label legend is displaied on right side of the Chart.

Percentage value is used for y and x is number to show the average backers per project.

#### insight

From the chart we can easily find out that the category with highest success rate is Camera Equipment and the most popular technology is Space Exploration. Within all Categories, Apps have lowest success rate and is least popular.
The relation between the popularity and success rate is not that clear since there are also conditions when a project have high success rate but is not popular (Makerspaces). 



### Q2

> Q3 in task list: Show the average amount pledged per project for each category.

#### explanation


For this question, I select the bar chart, which will display the amount very clearly.

Firstly, the sum of number of pledged for each category are calcuated. After that the Object with the pair of average pledged and its category is created.

After that, the data is shown using bar chart.

#### insight

From the Chart, we can find out that the average pledged per project varies for different category. The category with highest number of average pledged (Sound) have a nuber of over 80000, which have almost 80000 more average number than several categories with lowest values (Web, Software, Web and Makerspace).


### Q3

> Q1 in task list: Show the change in categories over time.

#### explanation


For this question, I select the grouped bar chart, which will display all the number of projects for different categories for each year.

Firstly, the sum of number of projects for each category for each year is calculated.

After that, the data is shown using grouped bar chart.

#### insight

From the Chart, we can find out that through the years, most categories are facing a huge increase from year 2013 to year 2014, the increase from year 2014 to year 2015 is stable and from 2015 to 2016 the project numbers for many categories are decreasing. 


### Q4

> Q5 in task list: Show the average percentage of the goal reached per category.


#### explanation


For this question, I select the bar chart, which will display the percentage very clearly.

Firstly, the sum of number of success projects for each category are calcuated. The sum value is divided by total project numbers for each category to get the average subbess rate. After that the Object with the pair of average success percentage and its category is created.

After that, the data is shown using bar chart.

#### insight

From the Chart, we can find out that the percentage of goal reached per category is ranging from 33% to 64%. Robots has the highest goal reaching rate and Web has the lowest goal reaching rate.
